              <h2>WHAT IS C?</h2>
              <p>The C programming language is a procedural and general-purpose language that provides low-level access to system memory. Many versions of Unix-based operating systems (OSes) are written in C and it has been standardized as part of the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX).
              </p>
          
              <h2>WHY SHOULD WE LEARN C?</h2>
              <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>C is a Middle-Level Language. The middle-level languages are somewhere between the Low-level machine understandable assembly languages and High-Level user friendly languages. Being a middle-level language, C reduces the gap between the low-level and high-level languages. It can be used for writing operating systems as well as doing application level programming.
                    </li>
                    <li>Helps to understand the fundamentals of Computer Theories. Most of the theories related to computers like Computer Networks, Compiler Designing, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems are based on C programming language and requires a good knowledge of C programming if you are working on them. In the modern high level languages, the machine level details are hidden from the user, so in order to work with CPU cache, memory, network adapters, learning C programming is a must.
                    </li>
                    <li>Fewer Libraries. C programming language has fewer libraries in comparison with other high-level languages. So, learning C programming also clears programming concepts to a great extent as you have to write lot of things from scratch. You will not be dependent on the programming language entirely for implementing some basic operations and implementing them on your own will also help you to build your analytical skills.
                    </li>
                    <li>C is very fast in terms of execution time. Programs written and compiled in C execute much faster than compared to any other programming language. C programming language is very fast in terms of execution as it does not have any additional processing overheads such as garbage collection or preventing memory leaks etc. The programmer must take care of these things on his own.
                    </li>
                    <li>Embedded Programming. C is extensively used in Embedded Programming. Embedded Programming is also referred to as micro-controller programming, where C program is used to control micro-controllers. Microcontrollers and embedded programming is widely used in auto-motives, Robotics, Hardware etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>Builds a strong foundation of programming.
                        Some say that C is the core of all programming languages. Learning C does not mean that you will only learn how to code in C but you will also learn how that program or code gets executed on a computer. You will learn about memory mapping. Thatâ€™s why it builds a strong foundation of programming.
                    </li>
                    <li>Minimal Distractions
                        C is a procedural programming language. So, you cannot implement various useful concepts of object-oriented programming such as inheritance, polymorphism etc. If you want to start learning object-oriented programming, you will first have to learn procedural programming.
                        
                    </li>
                    <li>A Foundational Language for Other Programming Languages
                            C is the foundation that most other languages and programming language creators have built other languages on top of C, including Python, Ruby, JavaScript, and C++. By knowing C, you are setting yourself up for success in understanding other programming languages widely used in the industry.
                    </li>
                    <li>Learning C can be challenging, but it can provide a strong foundation in programming concepts such as data types, variables, functions, loops, and arrays. C also teaches memory management skills, which are important for avoiding memory leaks and optimizing performance.
                    </li>
                    <li>Moreover, learning C can help developers better understand programming concepts such as memory management, pointers, and data structures. These concepts are fundamental to programming and provide a strong foundation for developers to transition to other languages and frameworks later on.
                    </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
