              <h2>WHAT IS C++?</h2>
              <p>C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

                C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.
                
                C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.
                
                The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.
                
              </p>
          
              <h2>WHY SHOULD WE LEARN C++?</h2>
              <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>C++ Popularity and High Salary.
                        C++ is one of the most popular languages in the world. It is used by some 4.4 million developers worldwide. Also, C++ Developers are quite sought and they hold some of the most high-paying jobs in the industry with an average base pay of $103, 035 per year. 
                        
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            C++ has Abundant Library Support. 
C++ has the Standard Template Library(STL) which is very useful as it helps in writing code compactly and quickly as required. 
It contains mainly four components i.e. algorithms, containers, functions, and iterators. The algorithms are of different types such as sorting, searching, etc. The containers store classes to implement different data structures that are commonly used such as stacks, queues, hash tables, vectors, sets, lists, maps, etc. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            C++ has a Large Community.
                            There is a large online community of C++ users and experts that is particularly helpful in case any support is required. There are a lot of resources available on the internet regarding C++. Some of the other online resources for C++ include StackOverflow, cppreference.com, Standard C++, etc. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            C++ is mostly used in Databases. 
                                There are many modern-day databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, MemSQL, etc. that are written in C++. This is because C++ is quite modern and it supports features like exceptions, lambda expressions, etc. Many of the databases that are written in C++ are used in almost all of the in-use applications such as YouTube, WordPress, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram etc. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            C++ is used in Operating Systems.
                            All the major operating systems such as Windows, Linux, Android, Ubuntu, iOS, etc. are written in a combination of C and C++. The Windows applications are written in C++, while Android applications are written in Java along with C/C++ with non-default run-times for C++ support. Also, C++ can be used to develop the core of the applications in iOS. In general, C or C++ are used in operating systems because of the speed and strongly typed nature of these languages. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            C++ is mainly used in Compilers. 
C++ is closer to the hardware level and is a comparatively low-level language. Because of this reason, it is used in many compilers as a backend programming language. An example of this is the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) which is currently written mostly in C++ along with C. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            C++ is a major application in Web Browsers 
A lot of web browsers are developed using C++ such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc. Chrome contains C++ in the rendering engine, JavaScript engine, and UI. Firefox uses mainly in the rendering engine and a little in the UI. Safari also uses C++ in the rendering engine and JavaScript engine. All these web browsers and more use C++, particularly in the rendering engines because it provides the required speed that is necessary for the rendering engines since they need to display the content at an accelerated rate. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            C++ is mainly applied in Graphics 
Applications requiring graphics such as digital image processing, computer vision, screen recording programs, etc. use C++ due to its high speed. This can also include different games that have graphics as a big part of their structure. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            C++ finds its application in Embedded Systems 
C++ is closer to the hardware level and so it is quite useful in embedded systems as the software and hardware in these are closely coupled. There are many embedded systems that use C++ such as smart watches, MP3 players, GPS systems, etc. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            C++ is Portable 
                            Program developed in C++ that can be moved from one platform to another. This is one of the main reasons that applications requiring multi-platform or multi-device development often use C++.                            
                        </li>
                </ul>
